# Go IAM Fundamentals

![Auth Strategies](/images/blog/blog-image.jpg)

Go IAM is a comprehensive **multi-tenant** Identity and Access Management system designed to provide flexible authentication and authorization for modern applications. This guide explains the core concepts and architecture that make Go IAM powerful and scalable.

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Everything in Go IAM is multi-tenant by design.** This means you can easily create isolated environments called **projects**, where each project maintains its own separate ecosystem of:

- 🔐 **Auth Providers** - External authentication systems
- 👥 **Clients** - Your applications that need authentication
- 👤 **Users** - People who access your applications
- 🎭 **Roles** - Permission groups for users
- 📦 **Resources** - Protected items in your system

Each project operates in complete isolation, ensuring that data and configurations from one project never interfere with another. This makes Go IAM perfect for:

- **SaaS providers** serving multiple customers
- **Enterprise organizations** with multiple departments
- **Development teams** managing multiple applications
- **Agencies** handling various client projects
