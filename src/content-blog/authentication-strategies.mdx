# Authentication Strategies in Go IAM

![Auth Strategies](/images/blog/auth-strategies.webp)

Go IAM provides multiple ways to authenticate users securely. This guide covers **OAuth2**, **SAML**, and **JWT-based authentication**.

## üîë OAuth2

OAuth2 allows applications to access user resources without exposing credentials. Go IAM supports:

- **Authorization Code Flow** - Recommended for web apps
- **Implicit Flow** - For single-page apps
- **Client Credentials Flow** - For server-to-server communication

## üè∑Ô∏è SAML

SAML enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across multiple applications. With Go IAM:

- Users log in once to access multiple services
- Identity Providers (IdP) and Service Providers (SP) are easily configurable
- Supports enterprise integrations like Active Directory and Okta

## üîí JWT

JWT tokens are compact, URL-safe, and used for **API authentication**:

- Tokens contain user info and roles
- Easily verified with Go IAM public keys
- Expiration and refresh strategies supported
